本教程将会指导你如何以 _Chirpy_ 的风格编写博文，它值得你阅读，哪怕你曾经使用过Jekyll，，因为许多特性需要设置一些特定的变量。

## 命名和文档存储位置

创建一个名为 `年年年年-月月-日日-标题.扩展名`{: .filepath} 的文件并将其放在位于根目录下的 `_posts`{: .filepath}。需要注意， `扩展名`{: .filepath} 必须是 `md`{: .filepath} 或 `markdown`{: .filepath} 中的一个。如果你想节约在创建文件上花费的时间，请接入名为 [`Jekyll-Compose`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-compose) 的扩展以实现。

## 前文

首先，你需要填写 [前文](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) ，它位于文章开头，格式如下:

```yaml
---
title: 标题
date: 年年年年-月月-日日 时时:分分:秒秒 +/-时区
categories: [一级分类, 二级分类]
tags: [标签]     # 如果使用英文标签，必须为全小写
---
```

> 博文的 _格式_ 已经默认被设为 `post` 所以在_前文_中没有必要再添加`layout`变量。
{: .prompt-tip }

### 时区

为了精确地记录文章发布的时间，你不仅应该在`_config.yml`{: .filepath}中设置`timezone`变量，还要在博文前文的`date`变量下提供时区数据，其格式为`+-TTTT`，例如`+0800`就是东八区。

### 分类与标签
每篇博文前文中的 `categories` (分类)至多可以容纳两项, 而 `tags` (标签)可为0到无穷个，例如：

```yaml
---
categories: [Animal, Insect]
tags: [bee]
---
```

### Author Information

The author information of the post usually does not need to be filled in the _Front Matter_ , they will be obtained from variables `social.name` and the first entry of `social.links` of the configuration file by default. But you can also override it as follows:

Adding author information in `_data/authors.yml` (If your website doesn't have this file, don't hesitate to create one).

```yaml
<author_id>:
  name: <full name>
  twitter: <twitter_of_author>
  url: <homepage_of_author>
```
{: file="_data/authors.yml" }

And then use `author` to specify a single entry or `authors` to specify multiple entries:

```yaml
---
author: <author_id>                     # for single entry
# or
authors: [<author1_id>, <author2_id>]   # for multiple entries
---
```

Having said that, the key `author` can also identify multiple entries.

> The benefit of reading the author information from the file `_data/authors.yml`{: .filepath } is that the page will have the meta tag `twitter:creator`, which enriches the [Twitter Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/guides/getting-started#card-and-content-attribution) and is good for SEO.
{: .prompt-info }

### Post Description

By default, the first words of the post are used to display on the home page for a list of posts, in the _Further Reading_ section, and in the XML of the RSS feed. If you don't want to display the auto-generated description for the post, you can customize it using the `description` field in the _Front Matter_ as follows:

```yaml
---
description: Short summary of the post.
---
```

Additionally, the `description` text will also be displayed under the post title on the post's page.

## Table of Contents

By default, the **T**able **o**f **C**ontents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to `_config.yml`{: .filepath} and set the value of variable `toc` to `false`. If you want to turn off TOC for a specific post, add the following to the post's [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/):

```yaml
---
toc: false
---
```

## Comments

The global switch of comments is defined by variable `comments.active` in the file `_config.yml`{: .filepath}. After selecting a comment system for this variable, comments will be turned on for all posts.

If you want to close the comment for a specific post, add the following to the **Front Matter** of the post:

```yaml
---
comments: false
---
```

## Media

We refer to images, audio and video as media resources in _Chirpy_.

### URL Prefix

From time to time we have to define duplicate URL prefixes for multiple resources in a post, which is a boring task that you can avoid by setting two parameters.

- If you are using a CDN to host media files, you can specify the `cdn` in `_config.yml`{: .filepath }. The URLs of media resources for site avatar and posts are then prefixed with the CDN domain name.

  ```yaml
  cdn: https://cdn.com
  ```
  {: file='_config.yml' .nolineno }

- To specify the resource path prefix for the current post/page range, set `media_subpath` in the _front matter_ of the post:

  ```yaml
  ---
  media_subpath: /path/to/media/
  ---
  ```
  {: .nolineno }

The option `site.cdn` and `page.media_subpath` can be used individually or in combination to flexibly compose the final resource URL: `[site.cdn/][page.media_subpath/]file.ext`

### Images

#### Caption

Add italics to the next line of an image, then it will become the caption and appear at the bottom of the image:

```markdown
![img-description](/path/to/image)
_Image Caption_
```
{: .nolineno}

#### Size

To prevent the page content layout from shifting when the image is loaded, we should set the width and height for each image.

```markdown
![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width="700" height="400" }
```
{: .nolineno}

> For an SVG, you have to at least specify its _width_, otherwise it won't be rendered.
{: .prompt-info }

Starting from _Chirpy v5.0.0_, `height` and `width` support abbreviations (`height` → `h`, `width` → `w`). The following example has the same effect as the above:

```markdown
![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: w="700" h="400" }
```
{: .nolineno}

#### Position

By default, the image is centered, but you can specify the position by using one of the classes `normal`, `left`, and `right`.

> Once the position is specified, the image caption should not be added.
{: .prompt-warning }

- **Normal position**

  Image will be left aligned in below sample:

  ```markdown
  ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .normal }
  ```
  {: .nolineno}

- **Float to the left**

  ```markdown
  ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .left }
  ```
  {: .nolineno}

- **Float to the right**

  ```markdown
  ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .right }
  ```
  {: .nolineno}

#### Dark/Light mode

You can make images follow theme preferences in dark/light mode. This requires you to prepare two images, one for dark mode and one for light mode, and then assign them a specific class (`dark` or `light`):

```markdown
![Light mode only](/path/to/light-mode.png){: .light }
![Dark mode only](/path/to/dark-mode.png){: .dark }
```

#### Shadow

The screenshots of the program window can be considered to show the shadow effect:

```markdown
![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .shadow }
```
{: .nolineno}

#### Preview Image

If you want to add an image at the top of the post, please provide an image with a resolution of `1200 x 630`. Please note that if the image aspect ratio does not meet `1.91 : 1`, the image will be scaled and cropped.

Knowing these prerequisites, you can start setting the image's attribute:

```yaml
---
image:
  path: /path/to/image
  alt: image alternative text
---
```

Note that the [`media_subpath`](#url-prefix) can also be passed to the preview image, that is, when it has been set, the attribute `path` only needs the image file name.

For simple use, you can also just use `image` to define the path.

```yml
---
image: /path/to/image
---
```

#### LQIP

For preview images:

```yaml
---
image:
  lqip: /path/to/lqip-file # or base64 URI
---
```

For normal images:

```markdown
![Image description](/path/to/image){: lqip="/path/to/lqip-file" }
```
{: .nolineno }

### Video

#### Social Media Platform

You can embed videos from social media platforms with the following syntax:

```liquid
{% include embed/{Platform}.html id='{ID}' %}
```

Where `Platform` is the lowercase of the platform name, and `ID` is the video ID.

The following table shows how to get the two parameters we need in a given video URL, and you can also know the currently supported video platforms.

| Video URL                                                                                          | Platform   | ID             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | :------------- |
| [https://www.**youtube**.com/watch?v=**H-B46URT4mg**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-B46URT4mg) | `youtube`  | `H-B46URT4mg`  |
| [https://www.**twitch**.tv/videos/**1634779211**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1634779211)         | `twitch`   | `1634779211`   |
| [https://www.**bilibili**.com/video/**BV1Q44y1B7Wf**](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Q44y1B7Wf) | `bilibili` | `BV1Q44y1B7Wf` |

#### Video Files

If you want to embed a video file directly, use the following syntax:

```liquid
{% include embed/video.html src='{URL}' %}
```

Where `URL` is a URL to a video file e.g. `/path/to/sample/video.mp4`.

You can also specify additional attributes for the embedded video file. Here is a full list of attributes allowed.

- `poster='/path/to/poster.png'` — poster image for a video that is shown while video is downloading
- `title='Text'` — title for a video that appears below the video and looks same as for images
- `autoplay=true` — video automatically begins to play back as soon as it can
- `loop=true` — automatically seek back to the start upon reaching the end of the video
- `muted=true` — audio will be initially silenced
- `types` — specify the extensions of additional video formats separated by `|`. Ensure these files exist in the same directory as your primary video file.

Consider an example using all of the above:

```liquid
{%
  include embed/video.html
  src='/path/to/video.mp4'
  types='ogg|mov'
  poster='poster.png'
  title='Demo video'
  autoplay=true
  loop=true
  muted=true
%}
```

### Audios

If you want to embed an audio file directly, use the following syntax:

```liquid
{% include embed/audio.html src='{URL}' %}
```

Where `URL` is a URL to an audio file e.g. `/path/to/audio.mp3`.

You can also specify additional attributes for the embedded audio file. Here is a full list of attributes allowed.

- `title='Text'` — title for an audio that appears below the audio and looks same as for images
- `types` — specify the extensions of additional audio formats separated by `|`. Ensure these files exist in the same directory as your primary audio file.

Consider an example using all of the above:

```liquid
{%
  include embed/audio.html
  src='/path/to/audio.mp3'
  types='ogg|wav|aac'
  title='Demo audio'
%}
```

## Pinned Posts

You can pin one or more posts to the top of the home page, and the fixed posts are sorted in reverse order according to their release date. Enable by:

```yaml
---
pin: true
---
```

## Prompts

There are several types of prompts: `tip`, `info`, `warning`, and `danger`. They can be generated by adding the class `prompt-{type}` to the blockquote. For example, define a prompt of type `info` as follows:

```md
> Example line for prompt.
{: .prompt-info }
```
{: .nolineno }

## Syntax

### Inline Code

```md
`inline code part`
```
{: .nolineno }

### Filepath Highlight

```md
`/path/to/a/file.extend`{: .filepath}
```
{: .nolineno }

### Code Block

Markdown symbols ```` ``` ```` can easily create a code block as follows:

````md
```
This is a plaintext code snippet.
```
````

#### Specifying Language

Using ```` ```{language} ```` you will get a code block with syntax highlight:

````markdown
```yaml
key: value
```
````

> The Jekyll tag `{% highlight %}` is not compatible with this theme.
{: .prompt-danger }

#### Line Number

By default, all languages except `plaintext`, `console`, and `terminal` will display line numbers. When you want to hide the line number of a code block, add the class `nolineno` to it:

````markdown
```shell
echo 'No more line numbers!'
```
{: .nolineno }
````

#### Specifying the Filename

You may have noticed that the code language will be displayed at the top of the code block. If you want to replace it with the file name, you can add the attribute `file` to achieve this:

````markdown
```shell
# content
```
{: file="path/to/file" }
````

#### Liquid Codes

If you want to display the **Liquid** snippet, surround the liquid code with `{% raw %}` and `{% endraw %}`:

````markdown
{% raw %}
```liquid
{% if product.title contains 'Pack' %}
  This product's title contains the word Pack.
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}
````

Or adding `render_with_liquid: false` (Requires Jekyll 4.0 or higher) to the post's YAML block.

## Mathematics

We use [**MathJax**][mathjax] to generate mathematics. For website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won't be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:

[mathjax]: https://www.mathjax.org/

```yaml
---
math: true
---
```

After enabling the mathematical feature, you can add math equations with the following syntax:

- **Block math** should be added with `$$ math $$` with **mandatory** blank lines before and after `$$`
  - **Inserting equation numbering** should be added with `$$\begin{equation} math \end{equation}$$`
  - **Referencing equation numbering** should be done with `\label{eq:label_name}` in the equation block and `\eqref{eq:label_name}` inline with text (see example below)
- **Inline math** (in lines) should be added with `$$ math $$` without any blank line before or after `$$`
- **Inline math** (in lists) should be added with `\$$ math $$`

```markdown
<!-- Block math, keep all blank lines -->

$$
LaTeX_math_expression
$$

<!-- Equation numbering, keep all blank lines  -->

$$
\begin{equation}
  LaTeX_math_expression
  \label{eq:label_name}
\end{equation}
$$

Can be referenced as \eqref{eq:label_name}.

<!-- Inline math in lines, NO blank lines -->

"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, $$ LaTeX_math_expression $$ consectetur adipiscing elit."

<!-- Inline math in lists, escape the first `$` -->

1. \$$ LaTeX_math_expression $$
2. \$$ LaTeX_math_expression $$
3. \$$ LaTeX_math_expression $$
```

> Starting with `v7.0.0`, configuration options for **MathJax** have been moved to file `assets/js/data/mathjax.js`{: .filepath }, and you can change the options as needed, such as adding [extensions][mathjax-exts].  
> If you are building the site via `chirpy-starter`, copy that file from the gem installation directory (check with command `bundle info --path jekyll-theme-chirpy`) to the same directory in your repository.
{: .prompt-tip }

[mathjax-exts]: https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/extensions/index.html

## Mermaid

[**Mermaid**](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid) is a great diagram generation tool. To enable it on your post, add the following to the YAML block:

```yaml
---
mermaid: true
---
```

Then you can use it like other markdown languages: surround the graph code with ```` ```mermaid ```` and ```` ``` ````.
